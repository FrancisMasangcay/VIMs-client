**Softerware to Install**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - We will be using node.js and the npm manager to download other tools and also to run along side the react.js front end
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  - React.js will make up the front end of the app and needs to be installed. You will also find the "create-react-app" repository incredibly usefull when starting your first react.js project
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - This is a backend as a service provided by Google that the project will use for database, authentication, and backend functionality purposes. You will need to globally install Firebase to your machine through Node.js' npm feature.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#features) a javascript library to make https requests use is for the front end react.js app to communicate with back end's api served through firebase functions
- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/related?hl=en) : an optional chrome extension that helps a ton with debugging a react project
